#oAuthTwitterTimeline
================================
This provides a really simple solution to authenticate and retreive a timeline (twitter feed) as raw json.

The idea stems from this question on Stackoverflow:
(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17067996/authenticate-and-request-a-users-timeline-with-twitter-api-1-1-oauth)[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17067996/authenticate-and-request-a-users-timeline-with-twitter-api-1-1-oauth]

I will be providing example usage in the following formats:
* Console
* Web application (todo: tested just need to add to project)
* Mvc application (todo: tested just need to add to project)
* Umbraco razor solution (todo: tested just need to add to project)

You can render it in your own format from the json, in the web apps I use jQuery.

I am going to improve and refactor this to take in key and secret via app.config and make the timeline more configurable 
(When/if I get time).
